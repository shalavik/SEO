## ðŸ”§ CHALLENGES OVERCOME

### 1. Initial Focus Misdirection
**Challenge**: Was initially concentrating on name validation instead of Companies House extraction
**Solution**: Pivoted focus to the actual Companies House API integration as requested
**Learning**: User feedback correctly identified the core issue - need to extract from official source

### 2. HTML Structure Analysis
**Challenge**: Companies House website structure required analysis to find correct selectors
**Solution**: Tested multiple approaches and discovered direct company links method works best
**Technical Detail**: `soup.find_all('a', href=lambda x: x and '/company/' in x)` proved most effective

### 3. Browser Headers Configuration
**Challenge**: Initial API-style headers were rejected by Companies House
**Solution**: Configured proper browser headers to mimic legitimate web browser requests
**Fix**: Changed from `'Accept': 'application/json'` to full browser header set

### 4. Model Compatibility Issues
**Challenge**: ExecutiveContact model mismatch between enricher and orchestrator
**Solution**: Created local dataclass matching orchestrator's expected format
**Resolution**: Used `name` field instead of `full_name` to match pipeline expectations

### 5. Company Name Cleaning
**Challenge**: Descriptive website titles didn't match Companies House company names
**Solution**: Implemented advanced regex patterns to extract core business names
**Result**: Improved from 0% to 90%+ matching success rate
