**Date**: June 13, 2025
**Status**: IMPLEMENTED & TESTED ✅
**Impact**: Significant functionality improvements with maintained zero-cost architecture

---

## 🔧 **KEY IMPROVEMENTS IMPLEMENTED**

### 1. **SEO Analysis Fix** ✅

**Problem**: Missing `analyze_company_seo` method causing test failures
**Solution**: Added backward-compatible wrapper method

```python
async def analyze_company_seo(self, company: Dict) -> Optional[SEOAnalysis]:
    """Analyze company SEO - wrapper method for backward compatibility"""
    website_url = company.get('website', '')
    company_name = company.get('name', '')
    company_id = company.get('id', company_name)
    
    return await self.analyze_website_seo(
        company_id=company_id,
        website_url=website_url,
        company_sector=company.get('sector'),
        company_size=company.get('size')
    )
```

**Results**:
- ✅ Method executes successfully 
- ✅ Returns SEO analysis results with scoring

- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained

### 2. **Enhanced Business Name Pattern Recognition** ✅

**Problem**: Low executive discovery rate (0%) for personified businesses

- `Mike's Plumbing` → Extracts "Mike" (Possessive pattern)  
- `Smith Heating` → Extracts "Smith" (NameService pattern)
