# CREATIVE PHASE: SEO Scoring Algorithm Design

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

Design a comprehensive SEO scoring algorithm that evaluates UK companies' SEO health using Google PageSpeed Insights data and website analysis. The algorithm must:

1. **Prioritize lead quality** - Identify companies with poor SEO that represent genuine opportunities
2. **Handle varied data** - Work with partial data when PageSpeed API returns incomplete information
3. **Scale efficiently** - Process 1000+ companies with reasonable performance
4. **Provide actionable insights** - Generate specific SEO weakness categories for outreach

### Core Requirements
- Score companies on 0-100 scale (lower = worse SEO = better lead)
- Identify specific SEO weaknesses for targeted outreach
- Handle missing data gracefully
- Weight factors by business impact potential

## OPTIONS ANALYSIS

### Option 1: Simple PageSpeed Score Inversion
**Description**: Use Google PageSpeed score directly, invert it (100 - score), and add basic weightings

**Implementation**:
```python
def simple_seo_score(pagespeed_score, meta_desc_missing, h1_missing):
    base_score = 100 - pagespeed_score  # Invert PageSpeed (lower PageSpeed = higher lead score)
    
    # Add penalties for missing elements
    if meta_desc_missing:
        base_score += 15
    if h1_missing:
        base_score += 10
        
    return min(base_score, 100)
```

**Pros**:
- Simple and fast to implement
- Uses authoritative Google data as primary signal
- Easy to understand and explain
- Low computational overhead

**Cons**:
- Oversimplified - doesn't consider business context
- No differentiation by company size or sector
- Limited actionable insights for outreach
- Doesn't account for data quality/confidence

**Complexity**: Low
**Implementation Time**: 1 day

### Option 2: Multi-Factor Weighted Scoring
**Description**: Comprehensive scoring considering multiple SEO factors with business-context weighting

**Implementation**:
```python
def weighted_seo_score(data):
    # Core SEO factors with weights
    factors = {
        'pagespeed_score': {'weight': 0.4, 'value': 100 - data.get('pagespeed', 50)},
        'meta_description': {'weight': 0.15, 'value': 20 if data.get('meta_missing') else 0},
        'h1_tags': {'weight': 0.1, 'value': 15 if data.get('h1_missing') else 0},
        'mobile_friendly': {'weight': 0.15, 'value': 25 if not data.get('mobile_friendly') else 0},
        'ssl_certificate': {'weight': 0.05, 'value': 10 if not data.get('has_ssl') else 0},
        'page_load_time': {'weight': 0.15, 'value': min((data.get('load_time', 3) - 2) * 10, 20)}
    }
    
    # Calculate weighted score
    total_score = sum(factor['weight'] * factor['value'] for factor in factors.values())
    
    # Business context multipliers
    if data.get('company_size') == 'large':
        total_score *= 1.2  # Bigger opportunity
    if data.get('sector') in ['retail', 'professional-services']:
        total_score *= 1.1  # SEO-dependent sectors
    
    return min(total_score, 100)
```

**Pros**:
- Comprehensive evaluation of multiple SEO factors
- Business context consideration (company size, sector)
- Weighted by actual business impact
- Provides detailed breakdown for outreach messaging

**Cons**:
- More complex to implement and maintain
- Requires more data collection
- Weights need calibration/validation
- Higher computational cost

**Complexity**: Medium
**Implementation Time**: 3-4 days

### Option 3: Machine Learning Scoring Model
**Description**: Train a model on successful lead conversions to predict lead quality

**Implementation**:
```python
def ml_seo_score(features):
    # Feature engineering from raw data
    feature_vector = [
        features.get('pagespeed_score', 50) / 100,
        1 if features.get('meta_missing') else 0,
        1 if features.get('h1_missing') else 0,
        features.get('load_time', 3) / 10,
        encode_company_size(features.get('company_size')),
        encode_sector(features.get('sector'))
    ]
    
    # Use trained model (e.g., Random Forest)
    lead_probability = trained_model.predict_proba([feature_vector])[0][1]
    return lead_probability * 100
```

**Pros**:
- Potentially most accurate with sufficient training data
- Self-improving as more data is collected
- Can discover non-obvious patterns
- Adaptable to market changes

**Cons**:
- Requires training data (which we don't have initially)
- Black box - difficult to explain decisions
- Overkill for initial implementation
- Complex deployment and maintenance

**Complexity**: High
**Implementation Time**: 1-2 weeks

### Option 4: Hybrid Heuristic + Learning Approach
**Description**: Start with heuristic model, collect feedback, gradually introduce ML components

**Implementation**:
```python
def hybrid_seo_score(data):
    # Phase 1: Heuristic scoring (similar to Option 2)
    heuristic_score = weighted_seo_score(data)
    
    # Phase 2: Collect user feedback on lead quality
    # Phase 3: Use feedback to adjust weights or introduce ML
    
    return {
        'score': heuristic_score,
        'confidence': calculate_confidence(data),
        'factors': get_contributing_factors(data),
        'recommended_actions': suggest_improvements(data)
    }
```

**Pros**:
- Evolutionary approach - start simple, improve over time
- Provides rich output for outreach personalization
- Builds learning capability for future enhancement
- Balances immediate utility with long-term sophistication

**Cons**:
- More complex initial design
- Requires infrastructure for feedback collection
- Longer development timeline
- Risk of over-engineering

**Complexity**: Medium-High
**Implementation Time**: 5-7 days

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Core Algorithm (Day 1-2)
```python
class SEOScoreCalculator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.weights = {
            'pagespeed': 0.40,      # Primary Google signal
            'meta_desc': 0.15,      # Critical for search visibility
            'mobile': 0.15,         # Mobile-first indexing
            'load_time': 0.15,      # User experience factor
            'h1_tags': 0.10,        # Content structure
            'ssl': 0.05            # Security baseline
        }
        
        self.business_multipliers = {
            'company_size': {'small': 1.0, 'medium': 1.1, 'large': 1.2},
            'sector_seo_dependency': {'high': 1.2, 'medium': 1.0, 'low': 0.8}
        }
    
    def calculate_score(self, seo_data, company_data):
        # Calculate base technical score
        technical_score = self._calculate_technical_score(seo_data)
        
        # Apply business context multipliers
        business_score = self._apply_business_context(technical_score, company_data)
        
        # Generate breakdown for outreach messaging
        breakdown = self._generate_score_breakdown(seo_data)
        
        return {
            'lead_score': min(business_score, 100),
            'technical_score': technical_score,
            'weakness_breakdown': breakdown,
            'confidence': self._calculate_confidence(seo_data),
            'recommended_actions': self._suggest_improvements(breakdown)
        }
```

#### Phase 2: Factor Weight Calibration (Day 3)
- Test with sample UK companies
- Adjust weights based on real-world data
- Validate scoring against manual assessment

#### Phase 3: Business Context Integration (Day 4)
- Implement company size detection
- Add sector-specific SEO importance weighting
- Create outreach message templates based on weakness patterns
