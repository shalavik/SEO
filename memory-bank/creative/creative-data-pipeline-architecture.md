# CREATIVE PHASE: Data Pipeline Architecture Design

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

Design a robust data pipeline architecture that efficiently processes UK company lead generation from initial scraping through to Make.com integration. The system must:

1. **Handle large datasets** - Process 1000+ companies with reliable performance
2. **Manage API rate limits** - Google PageSpeed API (25 requests/hour free tier)
3. **Provide real-time progress** - CLI progress tracking and status updates
4. **Ensure data quality** - Validation, deduplication, and error handling
5. **Support resumability** - Graceful handling of interruptions and retries

### System Requirements
- **Input**: UK business directories (Yell.com, etc.)
- **Processing**: Scraping â†’ Contact extraction â†’ SEO analysis â†’ Qualification
- **Output**: Structured JSON/CSV for Make.com integration
- **Performance**: Handle 1000+ companies in 8-12 hours
- **Reliability**: 95%+ success rate with proper error recovery

## OPTIONS ANALYSIS

### Option 1: Linear Sequential Pipeline
**Description**: Simple sequential processing where each stage completes before the next begins

**Architecture**:
```
Scraping â†’ Contact Extraction â†’ SEO Analysis â†’ Data Processing â†’ Export
   |              |                  |               |           |
[All data]    [All data]         [All data]     [All data]   [Final output]
```

**Pros**:
- Simple to implement and debug
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy progress tracking (stage-based)
- Minimal memory overhead per stage

**Cons**:
- Inefficient resource utilization
- Long total processing time
- No parallelization of independent operations
- Single point of failure for entire batch

**Complexity**: Low
**Implementation Time**: 2-3 days

### Option 2: Asynchronous Producer-Consumer Pipeline
**Description**: Asynchronous pipeline with queues between stages for parallel processing

**Pros**:
- Parallel processing increases throughput
- Better resource utilization
- Natural rate limiting integration
- Graceful degradation on failures
- Real-time progress visibility

**Cons**:
- More complex implementation
- Memory management for queues
- Error handling across async boundaries
- Debugging complexity

**Complexity**: Medium-High
**Implementation Time**: 5-6 days

### Option 3: Batch Processing with Database State
**Description**: Process data in batches, store intermediate state in database for resumability

**Pros**:
- Excellent resumability after interruptions
- Easy progress tracking and monitoring
- Efficient batch processing
- Clear audit trail and debugging
- Can pause/resume individual stages

**Cons**:
- Database I/O overhead
- More complex state management
- Requires database schema design
- Potentially slower than async approach

**Complexity**: Medium
**Implementation Time**: 4-5 days

ðŸŽ¨ CREATIVE CHECKPOINT: Architectural Options Evaluated ðŸŽ¨

## DECISION

**Chosen Option: Option 3 - Batch Processing with Database State**

### Rationale

After evaluating all options against our requirements and constraints:

1. **Resumability Priority**: Database state provides excellent recovery from interruptions
2. **API Rate Limiting**: Natural fit for Google PageSpeed API 25/hour limit
3. **Progress Tracking**: Clear visibility into processing status at each stage
4. **Implementation Timeline**: Fits within our 5-6 day architecture development window
5. **Debugging Capability**: Database state makes troubleshooting straightforward
6. **Resource Management**: Batch processing prevents memory issues with large datasets

### Architecture Implementation

#### Core Pipeline Flow
```
CLI Controller â†’ Pipeline Manager â†’ Database Manager
                       â†“
    [Scraping] â†’ [Contact Extraction] â†’ [SEO Analysis] â†’ [Qualification] â†’ [Export]
         â†“                â†“                   â†“               â†“            â†“
    [Companies DB]   [Status Updates]   [Rate Limited]   [Filtering]   [Make.com]
```

#### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE uk_companies (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    company_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    website TEXT,
    city TEXT,
    status TEXT DEFAULT 'scraped',
    seo_score REAL,
    contact_person TEXT,
    error_message TEXT,
    retry_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### Progress Tracking System
- Real-time status dashboard in CLI
- Stage-by-stage completion metrics
- Estimated time to completion
- Error rate monitoring
- Resume capability from any point

### Validation Criteria
- [ ] Process 1000+ companies within 8-12 hours
- [ ] Maintain 95%+ success rate across all stages
- [ ] Provide real-time progress tracking
- [ ] Support resume after interruption
- [ ] Handle Google API rate limits gracefully
