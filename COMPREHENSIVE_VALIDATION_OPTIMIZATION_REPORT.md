## üîß CRITICAL IMPROVEMENT AREAS

### 1. **Executive Detection Algorithm Enhancement** üîç

**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Impact**: Could improve discovery rate from 20% to 60-80%

**Current Issues**:
- Missing 80% of actual executives
- Poor name pattern recognition
- Insufficient content section analysis

**Recommended Solutions**:
```python
# Enhanced Detection Strategy
executive_detection_improvements = {
    "pattern_recognition": [
        "Expand executive title patterns (CEO, Director, Owner, President, Manager)",
        "Add industry-specific titles (Master Plumber, Licensed Electrician)",
        "Include family business patterns (Son, Jr., III, Family)"
    ],

        "Deep scan About Us sections",
        "Analyze team/staff pages",
        "Extract from contact forms",
        "Parse footer signatures",
        "Scan testimonials for owner quotes"
    ],
    "name_extraction": [
        "Improve name entity recognition",
        "Handle compound names (John & Mary Smith)",
        "Recognize informal names (Mike vs Michael)",
        "Extract from image alt text",
